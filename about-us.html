                <p>At Kokkari Estiatorio, we are driven by the concept of philoxenia, the art of making a stranger a
                    friend. This philosophy drives our efforts to create a cuisine fit for the gods with the
                    hospitality
                    of a proper Greek home — a restaurant that you would never want to leave.</p>
                <p>Named after a small fishing village on the island of Samos in the Aegean Sea, Kokkari is the
                    sister
                    restaurant to acclaimed Evvia Estiatorio in Palo Alto, California.
                </p>
                <p>Legendary Kokkari is the site where Orion, son of the Greek god Poseidon, fell in love with the
                    daughter of the King of Chios. For her love, Orion foraged the island for wild game and seafood
                    to
                    prepare elaborate banquets: Cuisine fit for the gods.</p>
                <p>On entering Kokkari, guests experience the old-world charm of a rustic Mediterranean country inn.
                    An
                    inviting fireplace, extensive woodwork, hand-made pottery and freshly picked flowers all reflect
                    the
                    warmth and tradition of ages-old hospitality.</p>

                    “Running a restaurant is all about taking care of people,” says Paul Kirby who has been at the
                    helm
                    of Kokkari Estiatorio since 2000. “From your staff to each and every guest that comes into your
                    establishment, it is important to make everyone feel comfortable and welcome. Restaurant
                    employees
                    that are valued and respected take pride in their work and truly enjoy their jobs. This
                    translates
                    directly to the guest experience.”</p>
                <p>
                    While Paul may be soft-spoken and charming (qualities he attributes to his Southern upbringing),
                    he
                    is extremely driven. His dedicated, hands-on approach to management ensures the high standards
                    of
                    service and hospitality at the restaurant have stayed consistent for over 15 years. Under Kirby,
                    Kokkari’s refreshing approach to service emphasizes the emotional elements of hospitality: Have
                    a
                    good time and above all, make sure the guests have a great time.</p>

                <p> Paul came to the West Coast after years managing waterfront restaurant properties in The
                    Hamptons
                    outside of New York City. His first job in San Francisco was working alongside acclaimed, Bay
                    Area
                    Chef, Reed Hearon as General Manager of Rose Pistola. After three years with Hearon he came to
                    Kokkari Estiatorio bringing with him a genuine appreciation and knowledge of rustic
                    Meditteranean
                    cuisine and wines, an essential prerequisite for working at Kokkari. In 2006 he was named
                    Managing
                    Partner of both Kokkari and Evvia in Palo Alto.</p>

                <p>
                    Erik Cosselmon’s wide-ranging Mediterranean repertoire and strong, ingredient-driven style finds
                    full expression in the Greek-inspired menus at Kokkari and sister restaurant Evvia in Palo Alto.
                    Since being named Executive Chef of Kokkari in 2004, Cosselmon’s brand of casual tavern cuisine
                    has
                    attracted even more devotees, earning Kokkari top ratings in both local and National press
                    publications. “The goal at Kokkari and Evvia is to offer as close to a true Greek restaurant
                    experience as possible. Not only is it about good food, it’s about the people, the celebratory
                    atmosphere and the Greek hospitality.”</p>
                <p>
                    Erik grew up on a farm in Central Michigan helping his mom tend their extensive kitchen garden
                    and
                    his dad cook for the large parties the family would host. This introduction to farm-fresh
                    ingredients and cooking cemented his desire to be a chef at an early age. After completing a
                    degree
                    at The Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, New York he moved to Manhattan and began his
                    career working at notable restaurants such as Montrachet, Tribeca Grill, Le Bernardin and
                    Daniel.
                </p>

                <p> Cosselmon moved to San Francisco and in 1996 joined Reed Hearon in opening his landmark Liqurian
                    restaurant, Rose Pistola, in North Beach. In 1998 he was named Executive Chef. In 2001, ready
                    for a
                    new challenge, Erik left to run the kitchen at Cetrella Bistro & Café in Half Moon Bay where he
                    garnered immediate and consistent critical praise for his rustic Mediterranean food</p>
                <p>His subsequent move to Kokkari made perfect sense. “Since moving from New York to the Bay Area,
                    my
                    cooking philosophy has evolved from the formal French tradition to the less complicated
                    Mediterranean, with a focus on ingredients as opposed to the architecture of the dish.” His
                    leadership and cuisine has contributed to Kokkari’s extraordinary success as one of San
                    Francisco’s
                    busiest restaurants. In 2006, Cosselmon was named Executive Chef of sister restaurant Evvia
                    located
                    in Palo Alto where he oversees the menu. He also joined the founding Partners as a Partner.</p>
